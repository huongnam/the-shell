---------------WEIRD CATS WITH THE WIDEST RANGE OF AGE IN INTEK, DANG---------------


- the working hours/days each member commits to: 5 hours/day

- how often you will check-in with each others' progress: everyday

- the strengths and weaknesses of each member, and how to leverage/mitigate them for the project:
*Minh*
+ drinks coffee everyday, makes others feel energetic
- age, time-management
*Nam*
+ cute
- short of time, don't have the habit of planning and keeping track of work
*Tran*
+ she's like a blank sheet of paper that we can tear off without any regret
- young

- the allocation of the workload:
Minh 33.(3); Nam 33.(3); Tran 33.(3)
 We try to finish 6 features first. If there is time left, the remaining features will be taken in to consideration.


- the features you want to implement and how they interface together:

Minh: globbing ★✩✩✩
      path expansions (tilde expansions, parameter expansions) ★✩✩✩
Nam: quoting (quotes & escape characters) ★✩✩✩
     command substitution with the backquotes ★★✩✩
Tran: handling the exit status of commands ★✩✩✩
